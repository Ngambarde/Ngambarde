### ðŸ‘‹ About Me

By day Iâ€™m a Systems Engineer; by night (and most early mornings) I spend 25â€“30 extra hours a week experimenting with ML frameworks, reading new papers, and pushing projects from prototype to containerized deployment. I am finishing an M.S. in ECE, and Iâ€™m eager to bring this momentum to a team where applied machine learning is the core mission.

### ðŸ“Œ Pinned Projects

Here are a couple of projects I'm proud of. They showcase my journey from data ingestion and model training to deployment.

| ðŸ§  **[Intelligent Knowledge-Retrieval (RAG) System](https://github.com/Ngambarde/user-manuals-rag)** | A full RAG pipeline that ingests technical PDFs, embeds them using modern models, and allows for natural language querying. Built for scalability and cost-efficiency. | `LangChain` `GPT-4` `FAISS` `Python` `unstructured`                      |
| ðŸŽ¯ **[Aim-Trainer Performance Analyzer](https://github.com/Ngambarde/aim_trainer_analysis)**       | An end-to-end Computer Vision system that analyzes gameplay footage. Features a custom-trained YOLOv8 model (98% mAP) and a custom semi-automated data labeling pipeline using a hybrid model system (YOLOv8 and SAM2). | `YOLOv8` `OpenCV` `PaddleOCR` `PyTorch` `SAM2`                        |

<!--
**ACTION REQUIRED:**
1. Update the links to point directly to your repositories.
2. For the "Quality Systems Automation" project, I recommend creating a *new, public repository* for it. You can't show the proprietary code, but you CAN:
    - Write a detailed README.md explaining the problem, your method, and the results.
    - Include a Jupyter Notebook with a *mock dataset* that demonstrates the same *type* of analysis (e.g., loading data, cleaning it, running regression). This proves your skills without revealing company data. THIS IS A VERY POWERFUL TECHNIQUE.

### ðŸŒ± Open Source Contributions

I believe in building in public and contributing back to the community. I'm an active contributor to:

*   ðŸ’ª**[MLGym](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MLGym):** | Contributed an additional task to Metas MLGym framework (kaggle titanic survival task), an experimental framework that provides a "gym" environment intended to benchmark AI agents in a variety of ML/data science tasks
